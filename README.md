# POD_Application_1.0_OLD
Password Organization Desk (POD) first implementation of what is now PRIM. POD is out dated, check out PRIM!

NOTE: Although POD is able to encrypt files, it is unsafe to use as it relies on a fixed location to load passwords, keys, and the IV. Do not use to store actual passwords and data, this was for programming practice.
